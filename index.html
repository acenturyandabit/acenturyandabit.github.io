    <h1>acenturyandabit's space</h1>
    <p>I'm a software developer, teacher, and mechatronics engineer. This is my technical portfolio. I also have a <a
            href="https://blog.acenturyandabit.xyz/">blog</a>.</p>
    <p>Here's a few things I've made or am working on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>Sydney Quant Trading Mock Trading Engine (<a href="http://sqt-trader.acenturyandabit.xyz">here</a>)</h2>
            <p>Sydney Quant Trading is a society of university students who are interested in careers in Quantitative
                trading. I worked with a team of developers to design, develop and deploy a trading engine for their
                mock trading engine, which handled over 700 requests from 30 players in a fast-paced mock trading game.

            <h2>Fortknight: Begineer-Friendly Open Source Project (<a
                    href="http://github.com/acenturyandabit/fortknight">here</a>)</h2>
            <p>A coding project that new develoeprs can submit a pull request to, that is much more approachable than
                other open source efforts but also more technically challenging than existing first-pull-request
                repositories.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Text Glob Transformer UI (<a href="http://acenturyandabit.github.io/glob_transformer">here</a>)</h2>
            <p>Sometimes I'm trying to transform text data with an unknown pattern and I need a quick scratchpad to do
                it,
                where I can easily replace the input if something new comes up.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Eye-tracking Parallax Depth Effect (<a href="bigger_on_inside">here</a>)</h2>
            <p>An eye-tracking web toy that makes it look like there is a corridor in your screen. Move your head around
                to see the effect!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>2D Plotter for CSV/JSON (<a href="http://acenturyandabit.github.io/2d_plotter">here</a>)</h2>
            <p>A 2D plotter GUI, which generates coordinates in CSV and JSON. Useful sometimes in engineering.</p>
