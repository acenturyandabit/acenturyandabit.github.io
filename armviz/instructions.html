        How to use:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Compile and run your program, with some sample data.</li>
        <li>Copy the OUTPUT of your program (i.e. the 3 or 5 numbered rows) into the big textbox.</li>
        <li>Copy the run command (e.g. ./robot 1 1 2 2 3 3 -r -i) into the run command textbox under the big textbox.</li>
        <li>OR, you can set the parameters in the boxes below.</li>
        <li>Set the display settings: Scale makes it larger, Grid step changes the increments of the grid</li>
        <li>Hit RUN. Enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Disclaimer: This visualiser WILL NOT - </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Detect invalid arm positions, but if the arm lies outside the visible field, it lies outside the box.</li>
        <li>Display the initial conditions from your runcommand, because that's part of the assignment.</li>
        <li>Do your assignment for you!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>But you're smarter than it. I believe in you!</p>
